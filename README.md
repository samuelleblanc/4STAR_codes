Collection of Matlab codes used for routine and special analysis of measurements from the 4STAR instrument.
- Includes codes for combining raw 4STAR files (allstarmat)
- Includes codes for direct beam aerosol optical thickness calculations (starsun)
- Includes codes for zenith radiance calculations (starzen)
- Includes codes for sky scans, almucantar and principal plane (starsky, starskies)

4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning Sun-Tracking, Atmospheric Research) is an airborne sunphotometer instrument developed and operated from the NASA Ames Research Center.  This code repository is mainly used for internal development of 4STAR analysis codes for the 4STAR/Sun-Sat research team. 

These codes are grouped together in the 4STAR_codes subdirectory. General use codes can be found in the General_codes directory. AATS_codes combine some analysis software for 4STAR predecessor instrument, AATS-14 (Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer). atm_codes represent a combination of codes for General and special 4STAR use specifically relating to atmosphere profile and modelling analysis. 

Basic instructions for installing and running the 4STAR code library may be found at: https://tinyurl.com/4STARfirstinstall.

The codes contained herein are for scientific analysis. As this research is of an ongoing and evolving nature, legacy codes may still be retained, and some documentation may be incomplete. This code is published online in the spirit of the the Community Research and Academic Programming License. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~pat/extremal/distribution/CRAPL-LICENSE.txt 

Selected publications using 4STAR data and a version of these codes are given in the References section below.
